All Characters, when created, have:

* Health, starting at 1000
* Level, starting at 1
* May be Alive or Dead, starting Alive (Alive may be a true/false)

* Damage is subtracted from Health
* When damage received exceeds current Health, 
Health becomes 0 and the character dies
* A Character can Heal a Character.
* Dead characters cannot be healed
* Healing cannot raise health above 1000

Part 2
A character can't damage themselves
If the attacker is five or more levels above the target, they do 50% more damage
If the attacker is five or more levels below the target, they do 50% less damage
Characters have a 'range'. If he is a melee character his range is 2 meters, if he is an archer will be 20meters
When doing damage the character must be in range
